    In evaluating potential students for Honors Speech and Debate, three areas are of utmost importance.
    <br><br>First, grades are significant but not everything. If you have a strong interest in public policy, debate, or expressing your thoughts and opinions, tryout.
<br><br>Honors Speech and Debate requires commitment. This course involves Saturday participation and travel. Each semester requires approximately three to four tournaments (including Youth and Government and the ACS| Speech Meet) with the potential of more. A student must practice and be prepared to be competitive. Grades are based on excellence and not solely on participation.
<br><br>When selecting class members, the needs of the team are considered. Debate is a team activity. Interpretation involves solo performers or, at most, duos (groups of two). This class focuses on public forum and congressional debate. PF debate is a prerequisite for the first year.
<br><br>Students are encouraged to review the website, www.nationalspeechanddebate.org, and email Mrs. Robinson (robinson@nrcaknights.com) with any questions.
<br><br>The try out involves four sections. First, you give a brief personal statement (no longer than two minutes). Current team members may ask you questions about yourself, your likes, and dislikes. Each student also gives another two-minute presentation taking a position (pro or con) on the below resolution. Again, you will be asked questions. We are currently debating this. Do not rely on Al.
<br><br>Resolved: The United States federal government should ban corporate acquisition of single-family residences.
        <br><br>Another section involves answering current event questions from the class. An impromptu speech closes the tryout process. This is typically a fun topic that a student would consider fun to talk about.
<br><br>Acceptance into this class also requires parental involvement. You will be responsible to have one/both of your parents or an eligible adult judge potentially several times a year. Judging is a commitment of travel and time, typically an entire Saturday.
<br><br>Trying out is a commitment to the class. If you are selected to join, you may not casually decide on a different elective or simply drop. You committed and, most probably, took a spot that could have been filled by someone else.
<br><br>Please fill out and bring the form attached below with the required signatures on tryout day.
